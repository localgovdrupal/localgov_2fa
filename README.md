# LocalGov 2FA
Two-factor authentication for LocalGov Drupal.

Installing this module will install and configure the [Two-factor Authentication](https://www.drupal.org/project/tfa), with [Sodium](https://www.drupal.org/project/sodium) for encryption.

Once installed, users will be prompted to set up two-factor authentication when they log in, with a configurable grace period of 99 log-ins until they can no longer log in.
